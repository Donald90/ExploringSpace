 Welcome to "Exploring Space", here we are going to learn some of the key events in the history of the space exploration while practicing our coding skills.

 ## Sputnik 1 üõ∞
 After the WWII the United States and the Soviet Union were competing in the so called "Space Race"; one of the key events of this period was the launch of the first satellite in orbit called "Sputnik 1" on October 4, 1957.
 * Callout(Goal): Build and launch the sputnik using functions.
 Every function represents a reusable block of code, doesn't matter how it is implemented you can execute complex tasks, so in order to build a satellite like the Sputnik 1 you don't need to be a rocket scientist üòé.
