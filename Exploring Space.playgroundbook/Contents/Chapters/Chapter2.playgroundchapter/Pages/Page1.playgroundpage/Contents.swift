 ## Wernher von Braun üöÄ
 Wernher Magnus Maximilian von Braun was a german scientist who worked on the development of rocket technology in the Nazi Germany. After the WWII he was secretly moved to the US were he built the rocket that propelled the Apollo spacecraft.
 * Callout(Goal): Let's practice with Objects.
 An Object models a real world entity by defining its properties with data structures and its behaviour with functions. For example we can represent the scientist von Braun with an object that has a function to build a rocket associated to it.
