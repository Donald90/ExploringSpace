# Playground Book Description
My submission for WWDC18, unfortunately rejected ðŸ˜¢

This Playground Book shows three key events in the space missions history that are:
- The launch of the first satellite, the Sputnik 1, in orbit
- The mission Apollo 11 that brought the first men to the moon
- The development of the rocket Falcon 9 that can open new scenarios for the future

These events are presented as 2D scenes where the user has to build them and bring them to life using some coding concepts that are functions, objects and loops.
